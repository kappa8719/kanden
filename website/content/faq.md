# Can I use Kanden as a replacement for a Vanilla Minecraft Server?

No.

Kanden is a Minecraft server *framework*. The goal of Kanden is to provide a platform for developers to build custom Minecraft servers. **Kanden, on its own, is not a direct replacement for a Vanilla Minecraft server.** However, it should be flexible enough to build a Vanilla Minecraft server on top of it. You just have to implement the game logic yourself.

Kanden is best suited for building minigame servers that can handle large amounts of players. It intentionally implements the least amount of Vanilla Minecraft so that you can appropriately override and customize the logic.
